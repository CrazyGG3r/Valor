### A rogue-like environment for Reinforced Learning

Retardium, An AI whose sole purpose is to run for its life, for now through reinforce learning.
Valor provides you with a pygame based environment ( no gym, no gymnasium,no box2d and other head ache that i had to go through to implement reinforced learning in my course.)
All you need is tensorflow, pygame, a good knowledge of reinforcement learning (there are no if statements)  and a good cpu to train.
Right now its just a basic run and chase a.k.a pakram pakrayi.
I trained it and it decide going up is the best decision
so Retardium just teases 5 enemies by edging on the edges.

Upcoming features to be added inshaAllah:
- Everyone gets a weapon (retardium, bobs, players)
- Walls will be added
- Health for all
- Drops for all
- Even enemy will get to heal from drops
- A nerve wrecking human vs ai. Hell yeah human vs ai. you got it right. You vs Retardiium.
- Also you with retardium, survive together with retardium

Even though all of these features are present in other games like Soul Knight, SurvivorIO, StormEdge, EmberBane, DeadCell, Blood n Bacon..( i can name so many other numerous more examples xD)
Valor is not supposed to standout from them, instead, it is supposed to provide an Environment to implement your own algorithm (even though the code needs more refactoring and clean up) but then it will be easier to help you guys implement your own DQN or Any Learning algorithm.
Just make sure your algorithm supports a continuous environment.
You need tensorflow and Pygame xd


Feel free to contribute to make this environment better through your ideas!
